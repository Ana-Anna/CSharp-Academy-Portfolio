# üìã Habit Logger

A console app that helps the user to track and log habits that can be measured.

Inspired by the [C# Academy Habit Logger Project]([https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/11/calculator](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/12/habit-logger)).

# üß† Key concepts

- Clean, modular architecture built with composition principles and single-responsibility design

- Separation of concerns:

-App/ ‚Äì user interface flow and command handling

-Services/ ‚Äì business logic for habits, entries, and reports

-Data/ ‚Äì data access layer using ADO.NET

-Helpers/ ‚Äì input formatting and validation logic

- SQLite database with secure parameterized queries via ADO.NET (no Entity Framework)

- Auto-seeded database: generates initial habit data only if the database is empty

- Support for habit editing, deleting, viewing reports, and logging multiple entries
